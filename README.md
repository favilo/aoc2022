# Advent of Code 2022

To run all days:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Timings generated by:

The `cargo-criterion` crate is useful to get nice benchmarks.

```sh
cargo criterion
```

Though not required, this just doesn't have as nice output, and will deprecate plots soon:

```sh
cargo bench
```

## Timings
